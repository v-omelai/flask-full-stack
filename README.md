# Full-Stack Challenge

## Overview

This challenge involves creating a web-based calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. The focus is on a robust design that separates business logic from presentation, and is extendable for future enhancements.

## Usage

- **Create a virtual environment:** `python -m venv venv`
- **Activate a virtual environment:**
  - **Windows**: `venv/Scripts/activate`
  - **Linux or Mac**: `source venv/bin/activate`
- **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Run an application:** `flask run`

## Functional Requirements

1. **Core Operations:** The calculator must support addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), and multiplication (\*).
2. **Client-side Input Format:** It takes an operator and two operands as inputs.
3. **REST API Integration:** All operations and their results should be accessible via a REST API.
4. **Server-Side Logic:** The business logic, including calculations and result processing, must be implemented on the server side.
5. **Client-Side Presentation:** The client-side application should handle only the presentation aspects and interact with the server using AJAX/REST API.
6. **Multi-Application Support:** The REST API should be designed to accommodate multiple client applications without requiring changes to the API contract.

## Design and Implementation Standards

1. **OOP/OOD Principles:** The application should adhere to Object-Oriented Programming and Design principles.
2. **Extensibility:** Design the application to be open for extensions but closed for modifications (Open/Closed Principle). This means the core code shouldn't need changes for future extensions.
3. **Future Extensions (For Design Consideration Only):**

- Additional Operations (e.g., exponentiation - x ^ y).
- Complex Expressions (e.g., a + b â€” c / d + x * d).
- Varied Result Formats:
  - Simple Numeric Result (e.g., `{result:5}`).
  - Numeric Result with Color Coding (e.g., `{result:5, color:"red"}`). Color determination is based on the result number's parity (even: green, odd: red).
- The design should account for these potential extensions without implementing them at this stage.

**Bonus Challenge:** Implement an algorithm that organizes the operators and operands in a specific order.

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure that the API and server-side logic are robust and efficient.
- The client-side should be user-friendly and interact seamlessly with the server.

This challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate your skills in software design, RESTful API development, and client-server architecture.
